### Project Purpose:

This game was created for a Udacity Course project in order to demonstrate mastery of Object-Oriented coding in JavaScript.

### The Game:

The game board consists of a 5x6 tile board with three rows of enemies traveling at varying speeds from left to right blocking your path to the irresistible river just out of reach. Are you brave enough to reach the other side??

#### How to Play:

- The player can move anywhere within the board tiles using the Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys.
- If the player collides (overlaps) with any of the enemies, the player is immediately sent back to the starting point.
- Once the player reaches the irresistible river, the player is then sent back to the starting point to perform the death-defying feat again.
